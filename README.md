# Signed Service Workers

**This project is abandoned**

As far I could test is too hard to prevent some service worker from updating or even alerting the user about some unsafe update. 
That's because browsers can update Service Workers even when no page related to is is opened. Because of this behavior this project just don't makes any sense, then I just abandoned it.
